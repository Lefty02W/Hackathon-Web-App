# COMPSOC-HACKATHON-2019

The department of departmental organisation has recently re-organised the governmental into new departments because that's what they do. We now have the Department of Soon to be Healthy People, the Department of Monies, and the Department of Specific Sciencey Matters, among others. 
Recently there has been an increase in the general public disbelieving scientific facts. This is something the DSSM wants to address with new software to reach out to the public. The DSSM has been allocated funds to develop software for this purpose in each of their key areas, however none of them know how to program so have approached us to develop their software for them because students are cheaper. 
The DSSM has 4 further subdivisions; climate science, science education, biodiversity, and other. The Climate Science division primarily concerns itself with emission reduction, and acquiring and processing of climate data. The Science Education Division is intent on turning every child in the country into a scientist, and wants software to help with this. The Biodiversity Division includes responsible forestry and endangered native birds. The Other Division has dabbled in astronomy, and there's one guy that does paleontology and cartography. This division is open to any of your suggestions.
